# LMC
The little man computer (LMC) is a simple computer model.
It has 100 cells of memory,  a single register (accumulator), a program counter, an input list, an output list and a flag signal.

This project was developed in LISP and PROLOG for an university assignment.

The details of the two implementations of the project are in the README files of Lisp and Prolog folders.

The request of the assignment can be found in the file assignment.pdf in italian languages.
